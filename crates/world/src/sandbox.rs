//! (the addresses are given with each rule; "inferred" marks what was

//!
//! Every so often the area is scanned for things to do ([`Sandbox::scan`]):
//! chairs and other furniture, beds, food, people to talk to, idle
//! markers, and wandering. One is chosen at random, weighted so the same

//! times of day (sleeping and three meals) take over when they come round
//! ([`Window`]). Carrying the activities out (walking, sitting, playing a
//! marker's idles) is the caller's.
